Module 7

Overview/Purpose of Analysis:
The purpose the of the analysis explores the following:
1) Determine the number of retiring employees by title in order to make plans for the company's hiring program. 
This will involve deciding how many people to hire, who to hire to replace retired/retiring employees, and when, will will be determined by who
retires and when.
2) Identify employees eligible to participate in mentorship program.  In preparation for 
replacing retiring employees, the company plans on utilizing retiring employees to mentor their rep
replacement.  

Results: 
28,254 senior staff will be retiring in the next few years.  This is a significant finding 
since such large number of senior staff leaving the company may very well significantly 
change the company, not to mention the loss of knowledge, and company history.  This is why
it is important for the mentorship program to begin in earnest, to capture the impending loss of knowledge
and transfer such knowledge to new or current non-retiring employees.
